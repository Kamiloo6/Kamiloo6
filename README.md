# Hi, I'm Kamil 👋

⭐ I’m a beginner front-end developer with a passion for building interactive web applications. I’m currently honing my skills in technologies like React, HTML, CSS, SCSS, and JavaScript. My goal is to improve my ability to create modern and responsive websites, while exploring new tools that can help me build even better projects.

Besides programming, I love spending time in quiet, secluded places full of greenery, which provide me with space to relax and think creatively. I’m also interested in mechanics and cutting-edge technologies, especially artificial intelligence. I believe the future of technology is fascinating, and combining my passions with programming is the perfect way for me to grow.⭐
